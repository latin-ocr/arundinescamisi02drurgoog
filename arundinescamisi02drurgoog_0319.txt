Now is done thy long dey’s work:
Fold hhy palme across thy breeet,
Ι Fold thine anne, turn te thy rest:

Lee them rave.
Shedowe of the silver hirk
Sweep the green that folds thy greve:
Lot them rave.
Thou wilt not turn upon thy hedi
'Ohennteth not the broeding hee
Sweeter ’eones than celumny?
Let them rave
Thou wile never reise thine head
From the green that felde thy grave:
“ Let them rave
Crocodilon wept team for thee3
'l'he woodbine end eglatere
Drip eweeter dews than treitor’s tear:
γ Lee them rave.

'Rein makes music in the hee,

O’er the green thee folds thy grave:
Let them reve.
