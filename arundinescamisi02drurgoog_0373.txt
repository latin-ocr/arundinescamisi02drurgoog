Foou Groonland's ioy mountains,
From India's ooral strand,

⁵ Whoro Afric’s sunny fountains

Roll down their golden sand 3
From many an ancient river,

From many a palmy plain,
They call us to dolivor

‚ Their 'land from error's chain.

What though the opioy breones
Blow soso o’er Java's islo,
Though every prospect ploases,

And only man is vile2
In vain with lavish kindness
The gifts of God are strewn,
The heathen in his blindness

Bows down to wood and stone.

Oan we, whose souls are lightod

With wisdom from on high,
Can wo to men benighted'

The lamp of life deny2
Salvation! oh, salvation!

Tho joyful sound proclaim 3
ΤΗΙ each remotest nation

Has learnt Messiah’s nome!
