ARUNDINES OAMI.

Pasa hythe happy souls, that love to live:

I pray thee, pass before my light of life, “
And shsdow all my soul, that I may die.

Thou weighost heavy on the heaut within,
Weigh heavy on my eyelids: let me die

“O mother, hear me yet before Ι die!
Ι will not die alone, for fiery thoughts
Do ahape themselves within me, more and more,
Whereof I catch the issue, as I hear
Dead sounds at night oome from the inmost hille,
Like footsteps upon wool. I dimly see
My far-off doubtful purpose, as a mother
Oonjeetures of the features of her child Ι
Ere it is bern: her child !-a shudder eomes
Aeross me: never child be born of me,

Unblest, to yex me with his father’s eyes!

“O mother, hear me yet before I die!
Hear me, O earth! I will not die alone,
Lest their shrill, happy laughter come to me,
Walking the oold and etarless road of death
Unoomforted, leaving my ancient love
With the Greek woman I will riso, and go
Down into Troy, and, ere the stans come forth,
Talk with the yild Cassandra, for she says
A fine dances before her, and a sound
Rings e'ver in ,her ears of armed mon.

What this may be, I know not; but I know

That, wheresoe’er Ι am, by night and day,

All earth and air seem only burning fire.”
TENNYSON.
