Θατοῐὶιιε.
I'nn bid the hyncinhh to blow, ’

Ι’11 teach my grotto green to be,
And sing my true love all below
The holly hower and myrtle-tren

There all his wild-wood sweehs to bring,
The sweet Souhh Wind shall wanden by,
And with the music of his wing
Delight my rustling canopy.

Come to my close and clust'ring bower,
Thou Spirir of a milder elimo,

Fresh with the dews of fruit and flower,
And mountain heath and moory thymo:

With all thy rural echoes come,
Sweeh comrade of the rosy Day;

Wafting the wild bee's gentle hum,
And cuckoo'n plaintive roundelay.

Where'er thy morning breath has played,
Whahever isles of Ooean fanned,
Ι Come ho my blossom-woven share,
Thou wandering Wind of fniry land. ·

For sure from some enchanted isle,

Where Heaven and Love their sabbath hold,
Where pure and happy spirits smssn,
Of beautys fairest brightesh mould 3
