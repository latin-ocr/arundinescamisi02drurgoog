1 Kings xiiL 2⁶.

Pnopnm of aod, arise and take .

With thee the words of wrath divine,
The seourge of Remu, to shake
O'er yon apostate shrihe.

Where Angels down 'ohe lucid stair
Came hovering to our sainted sires,
Now, in the twflight, glare
The heathen’s wizard fires.

Go, with thy voice the altar rend 3
Scatter the ashes 3 be the arm,
That idols would befriend‚
Shmnk at thy withering charm.

Then turn thee, for thy time is short3
But trane not o'er the former way,
Lest idol pleaffllres court
Thy heedless sou] astray.

Thou know’st how hard to huny by,
Where on the lonely woodland mad,
Beneath the moonlight sky

The festal warblings flow'd 3

Where maidens to the Queen of Heaven
Wove the gay dance round oak or palm,
Or breath'd their vows at even

In hymns as soft as balm.
