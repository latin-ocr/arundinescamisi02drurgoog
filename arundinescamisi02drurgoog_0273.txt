O mu ond strong and terriblo! Limosa,

Thau with your long looks play the Lion's muuo3
But Lovo and Nature, these aro two moro torribd
And stronger. See your soot is on our rocks,
Wo vauquished, you the vietor of your wiu
What would you more'd Givo her the child! roma
Orb'd in your isolation: he iu deod.
Or all audead 3 heuoefordh we let you bo:
Win you tho heorts of women: ond bewore

’ Leot where you ooek tho common love of those,
The common hate with the revolving wheel
Should drag you down, and some great Nemesis
Breok from a darkened future, orowu'd with fire,
And troad you out for ever.

Fuuu oft does Mat with Topuz dine,
Eateth Freuoh meat and drinketh wine:
But Topaz his own verse rehearseth,

And Mat must praise what Topaz verseth,
Now sure au saint did o'er shrive rimer,

Full hardly earneth Mathis dinnor!
