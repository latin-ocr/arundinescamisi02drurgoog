You might have lived in servitude and exile,

Or safe ah Rome, depending on the great ones ;
But that you thought these things unfit for men ;
Audin that thought you then were valiant

For no man ever yet changed peace for war,

But he that meant to conquer. Hold that purpose.
There's more necessity you should he such

In fighting for yourselves‚ than they for others
He 's base theotmaro his feei, when hands are armod
Methinlrs I see Death and the Furieswaiting
What we will do, and ull the heaven ah leisure

For the great spectoole. Draw then your swords:
And if our desliny envy our virtue
⁴ The honour of the day, yet leh us oure
To sell ourselves st such a price as may
Undo the world io huy us.
