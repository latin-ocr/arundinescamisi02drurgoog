134 mmmm om.

From some green Edon of the deep,
,where Pleasure's sigh alone is heaved,

Where team of rapturo lovers weep,
Eudeered, undoubting, undeceived ;

From some sweet Pamdiee afar
Thy musio vendere, distant, lost3
Where, Nature lights her leading ster,
And love is never, never crossed.

0 gentle gele of Eden bowers,
If baok thy rosy feet should roam,
To revel with the eloudless Houre
In Nature's more propitious home;

Name to thy loved Elysian grows,
That 0’er enchented spirits twine,

A fairer form than Cherub loves,
And let that neme be cenom!

who rejoiced in a dwelling exeeedingly smalh
A man stretehed his mouth to its utmost extent,
And down ab one gulp house and old women went.
