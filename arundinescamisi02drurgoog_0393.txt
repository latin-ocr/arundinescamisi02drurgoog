Ruentem from §ttnem

0 Sevmns of the faithful deod,
With whom Thy servants dwell,
Though oold end green the turf is spread
Above their nerrow cell 3 ⁰

No more we oling to mortel oley,
We doubt ond sear no more,

Nor shrink to troad the darksome way,
Which Thou hest trod before.

’Twae hard from those I lovod to go,
Who knelt eround my bed, ’

Whose tears bedewed my burning brow,
Whose arms upheld my head!

As feding from my dirzy eyes,
I sought their forms in vain,

The bitterness of⁰death I knew,
And gronned to live again.

’Twes dreadful when the Aoouser’s power
Asseiled my sinking heort,

Reoounting every wasted hour,
And each unworthy pert:

But, J esus, in thet mortal frey,
Thy blessed comfort stolo,
Like sunshine in a stormy day,
Aoross my darkened seul.
