FAm Amonc is gone cetray 3
Pureue and seek her, every lover!
I’ll tell the signs by which you may
The wandering shepherdese discover.

(lequel end coy al once her air,
Both shudy'd, tho’ boch seem neglected3

Oerelese she is with erlful ecee,
Affeeling to ecem unaffected.

With skill her eyes deth every glauce,
Yeh chehge so econ you’d ne’er suspect chem3
For she'd persuade they wcund by chance,
Tho' certain eim and art direct them.

She likee herself, yet others heles
For that, which in herself she prizes ;
And, while she laughs ah them, forgets
She ie the thing thal she despises.
