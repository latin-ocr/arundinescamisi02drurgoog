Wnnm petty offenees end feloniee smmt,

Is there 110 jurisdiction for steeling a heartl

Yon, fair one, will smile end cry ‘Laws, I defy yo
Aeeured thet no peers ean be summoned to try ye
But think 1101 that paltry defenee will secure γε,

For the Muses and Grates will just make a jury.

ΤΗΕΝ fied she 10 her inmost bower, and there

Unelesp'd the wedded eagles of her belt, ’

The grim Earl'e gift: but ever at a breath

She linger'd, looking like a summer moon

Helf dipt in cloud: enon she ehook her head,

And showeffd the rippled ringlets 10 her knee ;

Unclad herself 111 haste 5 adown the steir

Stole on 3 end, like a ereeping 0011100111, 01111

From pillar unto pillar till she reached

The gateway: there she found her palfrey trapt

In purple blazoned with armorial gold„
