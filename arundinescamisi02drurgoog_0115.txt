Tm which her slender waist confined
Shall now my joysu] temples bind:

No monarch but would give his orown
His arms might do what this hm done.

It was my heaven’s extremest sphere,

The pale which held that lovely deor:
My joy, my grief, my hope, my love

Did all within this circle move.

A narrow compassi and yet there
Dwelt all that’s good, and all that's fair,-

Give me but what this ribband bound,
Take all the rest the sun goes round

With rings on her fingere
And bells on hermes,
