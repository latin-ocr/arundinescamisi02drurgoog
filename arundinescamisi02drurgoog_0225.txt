Mutetur.

Srnrrw on her rosen, reses,
But never a sproy of yew 3
In silence she repones,

Ahl would that I did too.

Her mirth the world required,
She bathed it in smiles and glee,
But her heert was tired, tired,
And now they let her be.

Her life was turning, tmning‚
In manes of heet and mund,

But for peace her ooul was yenrning,
And now peace lapi her ronne

Her cabined ample spirit,
It flnttered ond failed for breath‚
To-night it doth inherit
The vasty halle of death.

J ofin Tnorr was desired by two witty peers

Το tell them the reason why Asees hod ears:

‘An’t pleone you‚’ quoth John, ‘I’m not given to letters,
Nor dare I pretend to know more than my betters;
Howe’er from this time Ι shall no’er see your greces,
As I hope to be saved, without thinking of Aesee'
