411111 the §suo Night,

On* in tho stilly night,
Ere slumber’s chain hes bound me,

Fond Memory brings¹ the light
Of other days around me:

The smiles, the hears, of boyhood's years,
The words osleveshen spoken;

The eyes that shone, now dimmed end gone ;

The eheerful henrts now broken
When I remember all

The friends so linked together,
I've seen around me fell,

Like leaves in wintry weather ;
I feel like one who treads alone

Some banquet-hell deserted,

Whose lights are fied, whose gerlande dead,
And all but he departed!

’ Ι wnn tell my own deddy, when he eomes home,
¹ What lisele good work my memmy has done:
She has earnt e penny, spent a great,
And a hole is torn in the baby’s new eoas..
