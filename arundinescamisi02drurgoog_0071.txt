ARUNDINES OAMI.

'Lo as a dove when up she springs,

To bear thro’ Heaven a tale of woe‚
Some dolorous message knit below
The wild pulsation of her wings 3

'Like her I ge, I cannot stay;

I leave this mortal ank behind,
A weight of nerves without a mind,
And leave the eliffs, and haste away

O'er ocean-minore rounded large,
And reach the glow of southern alnes,

’ And aee the eails al distance riae,

And linger weeping on the merge,

And saying: ‘Comes he thus, my friendl
Is this the end of all my carel'
And circle meaning in the air,

‘Is this the endl 'Is this the endl'

And forward dart again, and play
About the prow‚ and back return

Το where the body site, and learn
· That I have been an hour away.
