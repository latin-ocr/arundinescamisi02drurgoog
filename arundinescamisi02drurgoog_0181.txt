Normus is here for tears, nothing to wall,

Or knook the breast3 no weahness, no contempt,
Dispraise or blam03 nothing but well and fair,
And what may quiet us in a death so noble
Let us go find the body, ¹where it lies
, Soak'd in his enemies’ blood3 and from the stream
With lavers pure and oleansing herba wash off
The clotted gore. I, with what speed the while,
’ (Gaza is not in plight to say us nay)
Will send for all my kindred, all my friends,
Το fetoh him henee, and solemnly attend
With silent obsequy and funeral train
Home to his father's house ; there will I build him
A monument, and plant it round with shado ’
Of laurei ever green, and branohing palm,
With all his trophies hung, and acts enroll’d
In oopious legend or sweet lyric song.
Thither shall all the valiant youth resort‚
And from his memory inflame their breasts
To matohless valour and adventures high:
'The virgins also shall on feastiul days
Visit his tomb with flowers, only bewailing
His lot unfortunate in nuptial choico,
From whence captivity and loss of eyes.
