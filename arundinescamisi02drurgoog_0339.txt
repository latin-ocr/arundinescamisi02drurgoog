'Trs done! dread Winter spreads his latest glooms,
And reigns tremendous o'er the oonqueoed year.
How dead the vegetable kingdom lies}

How dumb the tunefull Horror wide extends

- His desolate domuin. Behold‚ fond man!

See here thy pictured life: pass some few years,
Thy flowering spring, thy summer's ardent strength,
Thy soher autumn fading into age,

And pale concluding winter eomes at last,

, And shuts the soene. ‘Ah whither now are fied
These dreams of greatnesst those unsolid hopes

Of happiness? those longings after famei

Those restless cares? those busy bustling days ‘i'
Those gay-spent festive nightst those weering thoughts,
Lost between good and ill, that shared thy lifet
All now are vanishedl Virtus sole survives‚
Immortal, never-failing friend of man,

His guido to happiness on high.
