Lady Anna was buried in the east,
Giles Collina was buried in the west ;
· There grew a lily from Giles Collins,
That touched Lady Anna's breast, brmt,
That touched Lady Anna's breast„

There blew a oold north-easterly wind,
And eut this lily in twain,
Which never there was seen before,
And it never will again, again,
And it never will again.

To whom thus Michael, ‘Death thou hast seen

In his first shape on man 3 but many shapes
Of death, and many are the ways that lead

To his grim cave, all disma15 yet to sense
ἰ More terrible at the entrance than within.
