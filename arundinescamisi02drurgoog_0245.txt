ABUNDINES OAMI.

111( Μ Bag·

Goon peopIe all of every nort,
Give ear 0010 my song;

And if yon find it vendrous short,
Ι1 0000011010 you long.

In Islington there lived a man
Of whom the world might say,

That 0111] a godly rece he ran,
Whene’er he went 10 pray.

A kind and gentle heer’e he had
To comfort friends and sees3

The naked eve1y day he chad,
When he put 00 his clothes,

And in that town a dog was found,
As many dogs there be,

Both mongre]‚ puppy, whelp and bound,
And curs 01 low degree.

The dog and man 01 first were fn’ends ;
Βο1 when a pique began,

The dog, 1ο gain his private ends,
Went mad end bit the men.
