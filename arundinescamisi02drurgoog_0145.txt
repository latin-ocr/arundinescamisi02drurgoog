112, ARUNDINES OAMJ.

‘tte {Balsa of tte.

No forest fell
When thou would’st build 3 no quarry sent its stores
To enrioh thy walls 3 but thou didst he'w the flooda
And make thy marble of the glassy wave.
In such a pelace Aristaeus found
Cyrene, when he bore the plaintive talo
Of his lost bees to her maternal ear:
In such a palaoe poetry might place
The armoury· of winter, where his troops,
The gloomy clouds, find weapons, arrowy sleet,
Skinpieroing volley, blossomhruising haiL
Silently as a dream the fabrio rose,
No sound of hammer or of saw was there;
Ioe upon iae, the well-adjusted parts
Were soon conjoined, nor other oement ashed
Than water interfused to make them one.

Lampe graoefully disposed, and of all hues,

Illumined every side3 a watery light
Gleamed through the clear transparenoy, that seemed
Another moon new-rison, or meteor fallen

From heaven to earth, of lambent flame serene.
