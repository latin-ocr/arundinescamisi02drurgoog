No, Freedom, noi Ι will not tell
How Rome, before thy face,
With heuviest sound, s giant statne, fell,
Pushed by s wild und artless rsee
From off its wide ambitione base:
When Time his northern sons of spoil awoke,
And. sil the blended work oi strength end graue
With many a rude repeated stroke,
And munye burberous yell, to thousand fingments broke.

Bur now ferewell-I am going a long way
With these thou see’st—if indeed I go-

(For all my mind is olouded with a doubt)
To the island-velley of Avilion ;

Where fulls not hail, or rain, or any snow,
Nor ever wind blows loudly ς but it lies
Deep·meadow’d, happy, fair with orohard-lowns
And bowery hollows orown’d with summer seu
