206 ARUNDINES OAMI.

aba hatra af ittera.

. Tar iales of Greaae„ tha iales os Graeca,
Where burning Sappho lovad and sung,
Whera grew tha arta of war and penae,
Whera Delos rose and Phoebus aprungl
Etarnal summer gilda tham yet, ·
But all, except their sun, is set

The mountaina look on Marathon,
And Marathon looks on tha θεας ·
And, muaing there an honr alone,
Ι dreamed that Graece might still- ba free:
For standing on the Persian'a gran
I could not daem myself a slave.

A king sate on the rocky brow
Which looks 0’er sea-born Salamis ;

And ships by thousanda lay below,
And men in nations—all aere hist

He counted them at break of day 3
And when the sun aet-where were they?
