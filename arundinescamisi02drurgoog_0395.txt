When, soon or late, this feeble breahh
No more to Thoe shehl prey, Î¹

Support me through the velo of death,
And in the darksome wey.

When elothed in fleshly weeds again
Iweit Thy dread deeree,

Judge of tho world, bethink Theo then,
Theo Thou hnet died for me!

HEBER.

Gon, who modest earth end heaven,
Darkness and light,

Who tho day for toil host given,
For rest the night 3 *

May Thine angel-guerds defend ue,

Slumber eweet Thy meroy send ue,

Holy dreams and hopes attend us,
This livelong night!

HEBER.
