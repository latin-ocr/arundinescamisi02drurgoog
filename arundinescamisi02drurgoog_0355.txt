&pizele te e Δῖτὶειιῦ.

Wmm, be ie so, my friendt-rve done
With noiee, extravagance and fun:

Ι sear I’ve passed the fatal linez'

That uncheek'd mirth end unstopp’d wine,
The flow of wit that knows no bound,
The mem'y laugh's perpetual round,

Nay‚ e’en the soeial genereus glow

That all-enlivening grapes bestow—

J eys that a few brief ee’nnighte past,

I thought eternally would laet,

Or fondly wish'd, before they fied,

I might be number'd with the dead—
No more are triek’d with charms for me,
Nor wake my soul to jollity:

That if to Pleasure I incline,

No more Ι view her form in wine,

Nor if bleak Care besete my seul,

Can drown him in the sparkling bowl.
FarewelL farewelL delusive dream!

The joy of youth, the poet's eheme3
Enchanting soenes 'of mirth and glee,
Where all was gay and all was free 3
Where infant lore's first sparks were fann’d,
Cemented friendship’s strictest bend,
