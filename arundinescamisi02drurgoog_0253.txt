220 ARUNDINES cam.

1110 §Inpius 100100 ammei.

A 00000, a 101001 the charm was snapt,
There 0000 0 noise of striking clocks,
And 1001 that ran, and doors that clapt,
And barking dogs and crowing cocks:
A fuller light illuminati 011, ,
A breeze through 011 the guden swept,
A sudden hubbub shook the hall,
And sixty feei the fountiin leapt.

The hedge broke in, the banner blew,

The butler dmnk, the steward¹ scrawl’d‚
- The fixe 01101 up, 11ιο martin flew,

The parrot seream'd‚ the peacock squall’d,

The maid and page renew'd their 010110,
The palace bang'd and buzz’d and clackt,

And all the long-pent stream of life
Dash'd downward in 0 00100001.

And 1001 of 011 the king awoke,
And in his ohair himself uprear'd,

And yawn'd and rubb'd his Ace and spoke,
‘By holy mod, 0 royal heard!
