They, as ench horrent driven with rapid forne,
From Smithfield to St Pulere's ehnpe their eourse3
And in huge eonfluenee joined et Snowhill ridge,
Fall from the eonduit prone to Holborn bridge
Sweepingr from bntehers’ stans, dung, gnte, and blood,
Drowned pnppies, stinking spreta, all drenched in mad,
Deed cete and tumiptops come tumbling down the fiooh

Τοο late I stayeh forgive the crime ;
Unheeded flew the honre:

How noiseless falls the foot of Time,
Thar only treeds on flowers!

What eye with eleer accounh remarks
The ebbing of the glane,

When all the sends are diemond sparks,
That denzle as they pass?

Ah! who to sober measurement
Time’s happy swiftness bringn,
When birds' of Paradise have lenh
Their plumage to his wingsh
