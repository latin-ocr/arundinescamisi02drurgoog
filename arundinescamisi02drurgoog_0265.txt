ΤΗ fiowcr that smiles why

Tcmorrow dics ς
ΑΗ chat wc vich tc stay
Temphs, and then flies ς
What is this world‘s delightv
lightning that mocks the night,
Brief even as bright.

Virtuc, how smil it is!
Fricndship, too rare!

Iove, how it cells poor bliss
For prcud despair!

But we, th'ough soon they fau,

Survivc their joy and all

Which curs wc call.

Whilsc shics arc blue and bright,

Whilsc flowers arc gay,
Whilst eyes chat change erc night
Makc glad the day,
Whilsh yct the calm hours crcep,

Dream thou-and from thy slecp
Then wake tc weep.
