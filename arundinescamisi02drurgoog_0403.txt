Nothing therefore I need 3

In pastures fair, with wetere calm,

He djd convert and glad my seul,
And brought my mind in fmme,
To walk in pathe of righteoueness,

For Hie most holy name. ⁸

Yet will I fem· none 5113

, Thy rod, thy staff doth comfort me,
And Thou am with me still.

And in the presence of my foes
My table Thou shalt spread ,·

Thou shalt Ο Lord fill full my cup,
And eke anoint my head.

Through all my life Thy favour is
So frankly ehew'd to me,

That in hhy house for evermore

My dwelling-place shall be.
