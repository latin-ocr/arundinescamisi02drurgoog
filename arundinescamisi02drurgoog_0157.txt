Ill ARUNDINES clm.

Of both my parents, ell in flames ascended
From off the altar where an offering burn’d,

As in a fiery column cherioting

His godlike presence, and from some great act
Or benefit revesl’d tc Abmhsm's racel

Why was my breeding omler'd and prescrib'd
As ofa person separate tc cod,

Design’d fer great exploits, if I must die
Betray'd, captiv’d, and both my eyes put out,
Made of my enemies the scorn and gaze,

Το grind in brazen letters under task

With this heaven-gifted strengthl Ogloricns strength,
Put to the labour of a benet, debas’d

Lower than bondslavel Promise was that Ι
Should Israel from Philistien yoke deliver3

Ask for their great deliverer now, and find him
Eyeless in Gaze at the mill with slaves,

Himself in bonds under Philistian yoke.

Yet stay, let me not rashly cell in doubt
Divine predicti0n; what if all foretold

Had been fulfill'd but through mine own defeult,
Whom have I to cemplein of but myselfl

Who this high gift cf strength committed to me,
In what part lodg’d, how easily bereft me,
Under the secl of silence could not keep,

But weekly tc a woman must reveal it,
O'erccme with importunity and teers
