HAsw thou a oharm to stay the morning-star
In his sheep courseh 80 long he seems to pauso
On thy bald awfu] head, Ο sovran Blancl
The Arve and Arveiron ah thy hmo
Rave eeaselessly3 hut thou, most awful Form,
Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines,
How silently! Around thee and above
Deep is the air and dark, substantial, blank,
An ebon mass: methinks thou piercesh it,
As with a wedgel But when I look again,
Ih is thino own calm home, thy cryshhl shrine,
Thy habitation from ehornityl
0 dread and silent mount! I gazed upon thee,
ΤΗΙ thou, still present to the bodily sense,
Didst vanish from my thought: entranced in prayer
I worshipped the Invisible alona

Yet, like some sweet beguiling melody,
So sweet, we know noh we are listening to it,
Thou the meanwhile wast blending with my thought,
Yea, with my life and life’s own secret joy:
Till the dilating Soul, enwrapt, hransfuseh

Into the mighty vision passing—there
Asin her natmal form, swelled vash to Heaven!
