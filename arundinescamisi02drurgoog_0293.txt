Onnes, most bounteoue lady, thy rich less

Of wheeh, rye, barley‚ welches, oete and pees ;

Thy hurfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,

And flat meede thalched with stover, them te keep:
Thy benks with peonied end lilied bn‘ms,

Which spungy April at thy hese behn'ms,

Το mehe eold nymphe chasse erowns 3 end thy breem

Whose shadow the dismissed bacheler loves,
Being lass-lom 3 thy poleelipt vineyerd 3
And thy see-merge steri] end roeky-hard,
Where thou thyself dost eir: the Queen 0' the sky,

Whose watexy arch, end messenger em I,
Bids thee leave these 3 and with her sovereign grase,
Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
Το come end sporh: her peaeoehs fly emein3
Approach rich Oetes, herto entertain.
