Eum! Dmmr sat on a wall3
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall:
Not all the King's horses, nor all the Queen’s men,
Oould put Humpty Dumpty on the wall again.

Two children in two neighbour villages · ι
Playing mad pranks along the healthy leas 3
Two strangers meeting at a festival:

Two lovers whispering by an orchard-wall ;

Twp iivei bound fast in (ine with golden ease3
Two gmves grassfgmwn beside a grey church-tower‚
Wash’d with still rains and daisy-blossomed3

Two children in one hamlet bom and bred3

So runs the round of lise from hour to hour.
