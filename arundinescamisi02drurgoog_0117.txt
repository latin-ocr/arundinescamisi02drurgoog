ARUNDINES OAMI.

ωε sutrina.

Onoosr the darkest paru 0’ th' grove,
Such as ghosts at noonday love.
Dig a trench, and digit nigh
Where the bones of Laius lie:
Altars rais'd of turs or stone

Will the infernal Pow'rs have none.

Answer me, if this be don02
’ris done.

Is the sacrifice made fit?

Draw her backward to the pit:
Draw the barren heifer back3
Barren let her be and blank.

out the curled hair, that grows
Full betwixt her horns and brows:
And turn your faces from the surr

Answer me, if this be done?
’Tis done.

Pour in blood and bloodlike wine,
To Mother Earth and Proserpine:
Mingle milk into the stream:

Feast the ghosts that love the steam.
Snateh a brand from funeral pile: ,
Toss it in to make them boil:

And turn your faces from the surr
Answer me, if this be doner

’ris done.
