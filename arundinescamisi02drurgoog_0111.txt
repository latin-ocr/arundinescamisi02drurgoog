ARUNDINES OAMJ.

inmune.

When the remote Bermudas ride

In Ocean's bosom unespied,
From a small boet that rowed along,

’ Tho lietening winde received thie cong:

‘What should we do but sing His preiee,
Thac led ue through the watery meze,
Untc en isle so long unknown,

But yet fer kinder than our owni
Where He the hege see monsters wracks,
Thac list the deep upon their hacke

He lande us cn a gracey stege,

Safe from the storms end preletes' rege.
He gave us cn eterne} spring,

Which here enemels every 'thing 3

And sends the fcwls to usin cere,

In deily visits through the air.

He hange in chades the orange bright,
Like golden iemps in e green night ;
And does in the pomegreneies close

J ovele, more rich then Ormus shown

He makes the fige our mouths to meet,
And throws the melone ab our feet:

But apples plenis of such e price,
No trec could ever beer them twice. ,
