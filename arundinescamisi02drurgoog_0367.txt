Tho unweeried sun from day 1ο day
Does his Orestor's praise display,
And publishos 1ο every lond,

The work of en Almighty hand.

Soon es the evening shedes prevoil, ·
The moon takes up the vendrous tels,

And nightly 1ο the lishening 1111111 ·

Repeets the story of her birth:

While all the staro that round her burn,
And all the planels in their 111111, Ι
Oonfirm the 'tidings os they roll,

¹ And spread the truth from pole 1ο pole

Whae though in solemn silence all

Move round the derh terrestris belll
What though nor voice nor minstrel sound
Among their redient orbs be found 3

With saints and engels they rejoioe,

And uther 101111 e glorious voice,

For ever singing es they shine,

ίΤ11οΗ11111111111111ιεί1 us is Divino!

Bos not 1ο understand a treesure’s worth,
Till Time has stolen evay the slighted good,
Is cause of half the poverly we feel,

And makes tho world the vildemess 11 is.
