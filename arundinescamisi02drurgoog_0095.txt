ARUNDINES OAMI.

³11 mutuno.

Gon, pensive Nun, devout and pure,
sober, stedfast and demuto,

All in a robe of darkest gmin Q
Flowing with majestick train,

And sablo stole of inroe lawn

Over thy decent shoulders drawa

Oome, but keep thy wouted stato

With even step and musing gait,

And looks commerciug with the skins,
Thy rapt soul sitting in thino eyes·
There held in holy passion still

Forget thyself to marble, till

With a sad leaden downwardwt

Thou fix them on the earbh as fast. ·
'And bring with thee calm Peace and Quiet,
Spare Fast that 0st with Gods doth diet,
And hears the Muses in a ring

Ay round about J ove’s altar sing.
