He thought I was a ghost, mother, for Iwes all in white5
And I ran by him without speaking, like a flash of light„
They eall me oruel-hearted, but I eare not what they say,

For I'm to be Queen 0' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen
οἷ the May.

They say he's dying all fer love, bue that ean never be:

Theysey his heer’e is breaking, mother-whatiSthet to meh

There's many a holder lad 'ill woo me any summer-day 3

And I'm ho be Quaen 0' the May, mother, I'm te be Queen
0’ the May.

Lihtle Effie shall go with me 'eo-morrow to the green,

And you’ll he there hoe, mother, to see me mede the Queen 3

For the shepherd·lads on every side 'ill come from far away 3

And I’m to be Queen o’ the May, mother, I'm to be Queen
0' the May.

The honey-suelde round the poreh hae woven its wavy
bewerS,

And by the meadow-trenehes blow the faint sweeh euekoe
flowere .

And thewild marsh-marigold shines like fire in swamps and
hollows gray 3

And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen

’ 0' the May.
