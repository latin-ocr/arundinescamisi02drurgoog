Or holier joy he sang, more true delight,
In other happier isles for thern reserved,

Wh0‚ faithful here, from constenoy and right
And truth have never owerwed ;

How evermore the tempered ocean gales
Breatho round those hidden islands of tho blest,
Steept in the glory spread, when daylight faiis,
Far in tho sacred West 3

How unto them, beyond our mortal night,
Shines evermore in strength the golden doy;

And meadows with purpureo] roseo bright
Bloom round their feet alway;

And how 'twas 'given through virtue to aspiro
To golden seete in ever-calm abodes

Of mortal men, admitted to tho quire
Of high immortal Gode.
