Now that the fields aro dank and ways all miro, ¹

Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire
. Help waste a sullen day, what may be von

On smoother, till Favonius rerinspire

The fromn earth, and clotho in fresh 'attiro

The lily and rose, that neither sow'd nor spun.

Of Attio baete with wine, whence we may riso

Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air?

Το interpose them ost, is not unwise3
