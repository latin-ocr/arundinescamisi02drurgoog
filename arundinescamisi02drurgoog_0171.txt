138 ARUNDINES OAMJ.

obt Selom Banu·

Ome bugles sang truce, for the night clouds hed lowered,
And the sentinel stem kept their welch in the slry5

And thoueends hed eunlr on the ground overpowered,
The woery to sleep, end the wounded to die.

When reposing that night on my pallet of etrew,
By the wolf-soering faggot thoe gunmed the elain,

At the deod of the night e eweet vision Ι saw,
And thriee ere the morning Ι dreemt it again.

Methought from the battle-field’s dreedfirl army
Fer, far I had roemed on e desolate treek:
'Twes autumn—and eunslrine arose on my way
To the home of my fathers, that weleomed me back:

Ι flew to the pleasant fields treverred eo ost

In life’e morning merch, when my bosom was youngJ
Ι heard¹ my own mountain-gnate bleeling alost,

And Iknew the sweet strain that the eom-reapers sung.

¹ Then pledged we the wine-cup, end fondly Ι ewore

From my home and my weeping friends never to pam
My little ones kissed me a thousand times o’er,

And my uile sobbed uloud in her fulnees of hearh

‘Stay‚ stay 'with us-rest3 thou om weary and worn ,·'
And fain was the war-broken soldier ho stay:
But sorrow returned with the dewning of morn,
And the voice inmy dreoming eor melhed away„
