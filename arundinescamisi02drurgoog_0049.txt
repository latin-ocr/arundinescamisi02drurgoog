Wnnn first, beioved, in vanished honre,
The Blind Mon sought thy hand to goin,
They said thy cheek was bright es flowers
New froshened by the summer's rain.
The beauty, which made them rejoice,
My darkened eyes might never see,

But well Ι knew thy gentle voice,
And that was all in all to me.

At length, as years rolled swiftly on,
They talked to meos Time's deeay,
Of roses from thy soih oheek gone,
Of ebon tresses turned to gray.
Ι heard· them3 but I heeded not;
The withering change Ι could not eee;
Thy voice still oheered my darkened lot,
And that was all in all to me.

And still, beloved‚ till life grows oold‚
We’ll wonder 'neoth the genia] sky,

And only know that we are old
By counting happy hours gone by.
Thy oheek may lose its blushing hue,
Thy brow less beautiful may be 3
But oh! the voice, which first I knew,
still keeps 1116 seme sweet tone to me!
