Wmn London's column, pointing at the thee,
Like a tall bully, lists the head and lies 3

There dwelt a citizen of sober fama,

A plain good man, and Balaam was his name 3
Religioua punctual, frugal and so forth3

Hie word would pass for more than he was wortla
One solid dish hia waek-day meal affunde,

And added padding solemnized the Lord’s:
Constant at chureh and 'Obang05 his gaina were sure,

His givings rare, aava sarthinga to the poor.
The devil was piqu'd such saintship to behold,

'Amfflmmmmmmma

But Satan now is wiser than of yore‚

And tempta by making rich, not making poor.
Rous’d by the prince of air, the whirlwinda sweep

Tha surge, and plunge hia father in tha deep;

Then full against his Corniah landa they roar,

And two rich shipwrecka blesa the lucky ahere.
Sir Balaam nOW, he lives like other folka, ’

He takes his chirping pint and cracks his jokes.

“Live like youraelf” was soon my lady's word,

And la! two puddings smok’d upon the board
Asleep and naked aa an Indian lay,

An honest factor stole a gem away3
