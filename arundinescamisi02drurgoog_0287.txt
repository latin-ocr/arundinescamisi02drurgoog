Lnrunr on yonder ewelling bush,
Big with many a coming rose,
This early bud began io blush,
And did but half itself discluso:
I pluck'd io, though no better grown3
And now you see how full 'tis blown

Still as I did the leaves inspira

With such a purple light they shone,
Aa if they had been maile of fite,

And spreading so would flame anon.
All that was meant by air and eun
Το the young flower, my breath has done.

If our loose breath so much can do,
What may the same in forms of love,
Of puresh love and musio too,
When Flavia it aspires io movel
When that, which lifeless buds persuades

To wax more niso, her youth invadesl
WALLER.

I novun thee beautiful and kind,
And plighted an eternal vow:
So altered are thy face and mind,

’Twere perjury io love thee now.
