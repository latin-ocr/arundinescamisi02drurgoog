ARUNDINES OAMI.

1 “Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die!

She eeased: and Paris held the oostly 111111
Oua 01 arm's length, so much 1110 thought of pow
matters his spirit, but Pallas—where she shoo
Somewhah apert, her clear and bared limls
O’er'ohwarted 1111111110 brazen-headed spear,
Upon her pearly shoulder leaning oold,

The while, above, her full and earnest eye
Over her show-eold breast and angry oheek
Keph watoh, waiting decision, made reply:
‘Sall-revennae, sslf-knowledge, sels-oontrol,
Theso three alone lead life 10 sovereign power.
Yet 1101 sor power (power of herself

Would oome unoall'd for), but 10 live by law,
Aeting the law we live by without fear 3

And, because right is right, 10 follow right
Were wisdom in 1110 soorn of consequence?

“Dear mother Ida, hearhen ere I die!
Again she said: ‘I woo thee 1101 with gista.
Sequel of guerdon could 1101 alter mo
To fairer. Judge 111011 1110 by what Ι am,
So shalt 111011 find me fairest. Yet, indeed,

. If, garing 011 divinity disrobed,

Thy mortal eyes are frail 10 judge of fair,
Unbiass’d with sels-profit, ohl rest 11100 sure
That I shall love thee well and oleave 1ο thee,
