lttslse ot vtum.

Tmo sturdy noch, for all his strength,
By raging sees is rent in twain3
The morble stone is pearsed st length
With little drops of drizzling rein 3

The oxe doth yield unto the yokeâ€š

The steele obeyeth the hammer's stroke3
The stetely stsgge thot seems so stoute
By yelping hounds et bey is set 3
The swit'test bird thot flios about,
Is caught ot length in fowlesss net3
The greatest fish in deepest brooke,
Is soon deceived by subtil hooko.
Yee man himself, unto whose will
All things ore bounden to obey,
For ell his wit end worthie skill,
Doth fall at lest ond fede away.
There is nothing but time doeth waste 3
The hossene, the earth, consume st lest
But Vertue sits triumphing still
Upon her throne of glorions fame:
Though spiteful Deoth must body hill,
Yet hurts henot his vertuous fame,
But life or death, whetso betides,
The state of Vertue never slides. .
