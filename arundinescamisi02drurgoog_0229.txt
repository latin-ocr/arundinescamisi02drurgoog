196 ARUNDINES OAMI.

σα αμα nea.

Ge tell Amynta, gentle Smin,

I will not die, nor dere eomplain 3

Thy tuneful voiee with numbers jein,

Thy words will mere preyail than mine.
ο To souls opplent, and dumb with griefi

The Gods heve given this kind mlief,

what Musio should in sounds eonvey

What dying lovers dare not say.

A sigh or tear, perhaps, ehe'll gin ;

But love on pity ennnot live:

Tell her that heerte for henne were made,
And love with love ie only peid.

Tell her my woes so feet increase,

what soon they will be past redrees;

But ahl the wretch, that epeeehless h'es,
Attends but death to close his eyee

suoxnme.

' ὕεαῳαεαῐαα

xenonem δὲ κεῖσ’· οὐδέπστα μναμοσύνα σε’θεν
ἔσσετ’ οὐδέποτ’ εἰς ὕστερον· οὖ γὰρ πεδέχεις βρόδων
τῶν ἐκ Πιερίας, ἀλλ’ ἅφσνῆς κήν Ἀΐδα δόμοις
φοιτασεῖς πεδ’ ἀμαυρῶν νεκύων ε’κπεπσναμένα.
