ARUNDINES OAMJ.

'· on oe epto

Lo! where the moy-bosom'd Hom-s,
Fair Venus' imin, appear,

Diselose the long-expected flowero,
And wake the purple yearl

The Attio warbler pours her throet

Responsive to the ouekoo’s note,

The untaught harmony of spring:
While, whisp’ring pleasure os they fly,
Oool Zephyre through the eleer blue sky

Their¹ gother’d frogmnee fiing.

Where'er the ook’s thick bronohes streteh
A brooder browner shede ;

Where'er the rude end moos-grown boeoh
O’er·oanopies the glatie 3

Beside some weter’s rushy brink

With me tho Muse shall sit, and think
(At ease reolin'd in rustio state)

How vein the ardour of the crowd,

How low, how little are the proud,
How indigent the great!

Still is the toiling hand of Care:
The panting herds repose:

Yet hark, how through the peoplod eir
The busy murmur glowsl
