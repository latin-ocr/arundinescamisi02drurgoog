’ mettim!-

O'm’. desen pluius und nuhy moero
And withered heuthu I rove;

Whero tree, nor spire, nor oot appears,
I pass to meet my love.

But tho' my path were damnsked 0’er
With beautios e'er so fine,

My busy thoughts would fly before,
To fix alone on thino.

- No fin-orownod hills would give dolight,

No pulaoo please mine eye,
No pyrumid's aeriul height,

Where mould'ring monurohs lie:
Unmoved, should Eustern kings advanoe,

Oould I the puguant soe 3
Splendour might oatoh one soornful glunoe,
N or steul a thought from thee.
