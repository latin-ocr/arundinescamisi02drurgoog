ARUNDINES OAMI.

When (eod knows) I’m tossed about
Either with despair or doubt3
Yee before the glass runs ont,
Sweeh Spiris, eomfort mel

When the sempter me pursneth ,
With the sins of all my youth,
And half demns me with their tenth,
Sweet spiris, comfort mel

When the flames end hellish eries
Frighe my ears and frighe my eyes,
And all terrers me surprise,
Sweet spirit, comfort mel

When the Judgment is reveeled,
And thas open, which was heled,

When to Thes I have eppeeled‚
Sweeh Spiris, comforh me!

Tne speeious firmament on high, ¹
And all the blue ethereel shy,

The spengled beessus, e shining fremo,
Their great Originel proeleim.
