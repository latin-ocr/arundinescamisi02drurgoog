-ARUNDINES omi.

Zitanp of the {help spirit.

In the honr of my distress,
When temptatione sore oppress, ’
And when I my sino confess,

Sweet Spimt, oomfort mo!

When I lie within my bed,
Siok in heom and siok in head,
And with doubts disoomfitess
Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

When the house doth eigh and ποορ,
And 'ohe world is drowned in eleep‚
Yet mine eyes their vigile keep,
Sweet Spirin eomforb me!

When 'ohe passing bell doth toll,
And the furies in a shoal
Oome to ffight my parting soul,
Sweet spirit, oomfort me!

When the 'capere all bum blue,
When the oomfomers ere few,
And that number more then true,
Sweet spirit, comfort mo!

When the prieet his last hee prayed,
And I nod to what is said,

'Oense my speech is now deoayed,
Sweet spirit, comfort me!
