ARUNDJNas orm.

'Phe panthe1²smar oame muffled, as Ι sat

Low in the valley. N ever, never more

Shall lone OEnone see the morning mist

Sweep thro’ them: never see them overlaid

With narrow moonlit strips of silver cloud,
Between the loud stream and the trembling stara

“O mother, hear me yet before I die!
I wish that somewhere in the ruin’d folda,
Among the fragmenta tumbled from the glona,
Orthe dry thicketa, I eould meet with her,
The Abominable, that uninvited came
Into the fair Peleian banquet-hall,
And east the golden fruit upon the board,
And bred this change: that I might spenh my

mind,

And tell her, to her face, how much Ι hate
Her presence, hated both of gods and men.

“O mother, hear me yet before I die!
Hath he not swern hie love a thousand timeo,
In thie green valley, under this green hill,
Ev’n on this hand, and sitting on thie stone?
Seal’d it with kiseest water’d it with tearsi
Ο happy tears, and how unlike to thesei
Ο happy Heaven, how canet thou see my facet
0 happy earth, how oanst thou beai· my weighti
Ο death, death, death, thou ever-fioating oloud,
There are enough unhappy on thie earth,
