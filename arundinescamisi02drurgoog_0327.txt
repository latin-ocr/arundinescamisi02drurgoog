How sweet it were, hearing the downwml stream,
With half-shut eyes ever to seem
Falling asleep in a halfdreaml '
To dream and dream, like yonder amber light,
Which will not leave the myrrh·bush on the height j
To hear each other’s whisper'd speech 3
Eating the Lotos, 'day by' day,
Το watch the crisping ripples on the beamh,
α And tender curving lines of creamy spray:
To lond our heatsss and spirits wholly
Το the influence of mild-minded melancholy3

To muse and brood and live again in memory,
With those old faces of our infancy

Heap’d over with a mound of grass,

Two handfuls of white dust, shut inan urn of brass

Home again, home again, market is done.
