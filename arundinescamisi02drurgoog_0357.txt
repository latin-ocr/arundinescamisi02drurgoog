ARUNDINES orm.

And both together bore along, ⁵

In union sweet, the power of song.

Enchenting soenes, that fancy loves, ·

Thac friendship's sacred voice approves3

On which remembrence oft shall dwell

With sad delight-deor soenes, ferewellf
Even so-I’ve passed che fatal line,

And other suns upon me shine:

But, os the home-sich ssilor sees

’Mid the waste waves his native trees,

And thinks phe wide-stretched watery scene

Fair mesdows cled in vernol green:

So ost· my fancy turns to view

These forms my livelier momento knew,

And, kindling at delusione vain,

Believes and hopes them back again:

Then, if I court their imaged cherms,

My fever'd soul is up in arms,

And sickoning nature proves st last

The passion weak‚ the moment post.

MERIVALE.
