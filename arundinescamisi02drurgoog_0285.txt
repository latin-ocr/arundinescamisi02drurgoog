‘Suu will you please to walk before‘l'
‘Nu pruy, Sir, you are next the door :'
. ‘Upon my honour, I’ll not stir’-
‘Sir I'm ab home—consider, sir 1’
‘Excuse me, sir, I'll not go first :’
‘WelL ifI must be rude, I must-
But yet Ι wish Ι could evade it 3
’Tis strangely olownish—be persuaded?
Go forward cito: go forword, squiras:
Nor uoruplo euch whot euch admires.
Life equares not, friends, with your proceeding;
It flios while you display your breeding.
Such breeding as one's grannam preaches,
Or some old danoing muster toacher.
Ο for some rude tumultuous follow,
Half orazy, or at least half mellow,
To oome behind you unaw‘areS,
And fairly kiok you both down stairo!
But, Death's at hand—let me advise ye 3
(ἕο forwurd7 friend& or he'l] surprise ye.
