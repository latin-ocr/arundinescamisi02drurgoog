{In memmium.

I leave 1ch prais& wthproesed
In verse that bn'nqs myedf relies,
And by the measure of my μνία]
Ι leave thy yreatmsn to be qumod.

What practice howsoe'er apen

In Μίνῳ aptast words to chima,

Or voice the νίσῙιεενιονινῶ mat sinas,
Ham power to qive thee as thou wart?

I care not in these fadinq days
To raiae a cry that lam not low,

’ Or rownd thee with the breem ossonq

Το ειὲν a little clusi qs praiae.

my leaf Ῑιαν perished in the φνεν·
And while we breatlae hemath tlte sun,
ww ¹world which credite what is dom,

Io oold to all that miqht have been.

So here shall nilenc'e φαεινά thy fasme:
But somewhere ονιι qs human view,
Whate'er thy hamd ie set to do,

Is wrouqht with tumult qf acclaim.
