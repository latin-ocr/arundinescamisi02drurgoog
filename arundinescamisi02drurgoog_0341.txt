(onnus. Ι

nm sni, ont oin ne shepherd fon,
Now the top of Hoavon doth hold 3

And the gilded car of day

His glowing axlo doth ollay

In 'ohe oteop Atlantio stream 3

And tho slope sun his upward boam
Shoots against 'ohe dnsky pole,
Paoing toward tho other gool

Of his chambor in ⁸'ohe East.
Meanwhile weloomo Joy and Feost,
Midnight Shout and Revelry,

Tipsy Dance and J ollity.

Broid your looks with rosy 'owines
Dropping odourS, dropping wine.
Rigour now is gone 'oo bed, ⁸

And Advioo with scrupulous heod3
Strio’o Age and sour Severity,

With their grave saws in olumber lie.
We, that are of puror fine,

Imitaoe the starry quire,

Wh0, in their nightly watohful spheres,

Lead in swift round tho months and years.
