Tim Oraoloo aro dumb,
No voioe or hideous hum

Runs through tho archad roos in words doceiving: Ι
Apollo from his shrine
Gan no moro divine, .

With hollow ohriek the steep of Delphos leaving·
No nightly oroneo, or brenthod spoli,
Inspires the palooy’d priests from the prophetie celi

The lonely mountains o'or,
And the resounding shore,

A voice of weeping heard and loud lament3
From hauntoi spring and dale,

Edg’d with poplar palo,
Τ111 parting-genius is with sighing 11111,

With flower-inwoven tresses torn,
The Nympho in twilight shado of tangledthioketo mourn,
