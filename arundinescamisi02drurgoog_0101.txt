&palegu fot ῑβῑιεβιιτε,

GLAUOOPIS forsakes her own,
The angry gods forgel us:
Bul still the blue streame along
Wahe the feel of the silver song, Ι
And the night-bird wahes the moon,
And the bees in the blushing noun
Haunl the hears of the old Hymetius. Ι

We are fallen, but noh forlorn‚

While somethingds lest us bo cherish3
As Love was the earliest born,

So Love is the last bo perish

Wreathe, then, the reses, wreathel
The beautiful still is ours 3

While the stream shall flow, and the skies shall glou
The beautiful still is ours

Wha'bever is fair or soft or brighb

In the lap of Day or the arms of Nigha
¹Whispers the seul of Greece, of Graece,
And hushes our cares with a voice of peace 3

Wreathe, then, the rosea wreabhel
They lell me of earlier hours 3

And Ι hear the beart of my eountry brealhe
From the lips of the stranger's flowers

BULWER LY'H'ON.
