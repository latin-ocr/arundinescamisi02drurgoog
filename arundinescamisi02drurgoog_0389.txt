Thy will· ht bunt.
MY θοὰ, my Father, while I stray

Far from my home in life's rough way,
Ο teach me from my heart to say,
Thy will be done!

Though dark my path and sad my lot,
Let me be still, and murmur n0t5

Or breatho the prayer divinely 'taughh
Thy will be done!

What though in lonely grief Ι sigh
For friends beloved, no longer nigh, “

Submissive Ι would still reply,
Thy will be done Ξ,

If Thou should’st call me to resign
What most I pn‘ze, it ne’er was mine,
I only yield Theo whah is Thine ‚·
Thy will be done!

If sickness wastes me to decay,
Let me with humble saith obey,
And teach thy servant still to may,

Thy will be dome!

Renew my will from day to day,
¹ Blend it with Thine‚ and take away
All that now makes it hard to say,

Thy will be done!
