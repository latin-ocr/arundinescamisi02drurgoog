Wnnnn these rude rocks on Bemard’s summit' nod,
Once heavenward sprung the throno of Pennine Jove,
An ancient shn'ne of hospitable Love ;

Now burns the altar bo the Christian’s Gon

Here peaceful Piety‚ age onage, has trod
'Ibe waste 3 still keeps her vigils, takes her rest3
still as of yore salutes the coming guest,

And oheers the weary as they onward nove,

Healing each wayworn limb: or oft will snm
Oatching the storm-lost wanderer's sinking cry,

Speed the rich cordial to his ebbing hearb,

Ohafe his stiff limbs, and bid him not to¹ die.

So task'd to smoothe stem Winter’s drifting wing,

And garb tho eterna] snows in more eternal Spring.
