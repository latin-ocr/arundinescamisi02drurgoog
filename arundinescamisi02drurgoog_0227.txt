· , Α serm eheft did I behold,

From sky to earth it alwred,

And poieed therein e bird eo bold,
Sweet bird, thou were, enehentedl

He eenk, herese, he twinkled‚ he trolled,
within {rhet ehaft of eunny mist,

His eyes of fire, his beak of gold,
Au else of amethyst!

And thus he sang: Adieu‚ Adieul
Love’s dreeme prove seldom true 3
The bloseome‚ they make no delay, ι
The eperlding dewdrops will nob stay. ·
Sweet month of May,
We must away,
Far, far away,
Teday, tedayl

fleete-

Wnrr Laura first, with heaven’s own redienee bright
Beamed in full luetre on my revish‘d eight3

Ere yet the wonder spoke, I saw, end loved:

What merble by such beauty were not movedl

But when, in tenes ee music eost and clear, '
With Nature’e melody she eharm'd mine ear,

Her tongue confirmed the triumph of her eyes: Α
Who sees ie wounded, but who listene dies.

WRANGHAM.
