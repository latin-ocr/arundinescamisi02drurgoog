LmnnkBo-peep hes lost her sheep, .

And can’t tell where to find them:
Lei ihe'm alone, and they'll come home,
And bring their teiln behind them.

Litnle Bepeep fell sesi neleep‚
, And ¹dreemt she heard them blenting;
But when she ewoke‚ she fo'und it a johe:
Poor Lady! they still were fleeting.

Then up she hook her little crook,
Determin’d· for to find them;

she found them indeed, but it made her head bleed,
For ihey’d left all their hails behind them.

It happen'd one day, as Bnpeep did stray
Unio a meadow hard by,
'There she espy'd their teile side by side,

All hung 'on a tree to dry.

She heav’d a sigh, and wip’d her eye,
And over the hillocks went smack-O,

And tried what she eould, as a shepherdess should,
To iaek each again to its back-O.
