ARUNDINES OAMI. ·

Before he monnio tho hill, Ι know

He oometh quiokly: from below

Swoet galea, as from deep gurdone, blow

Before him, s’diking on my brow.
Inmydrybminmyspiriisoon
Down-deoponing from swoon to swoon
Fainis like a domled morning moon.

The wind sonnds like a silver wire,

And from beyond the noon a firo

Is p0u1²d upon the hills, and nigher

The skios sioop down in their desir03
And isled in sudden sens of light, ⁸
My honri pierood through with fieroe dolighd
Bursts into blossom in his sight.

My whole soul waiting silenily,

All naked in a sultry sky,

Droops blinded with his shining eyo 3

1 will possess him, or will din
I will grow round him in his ploce,
Grow-live-die looking on his face,

Die, dying oloop'd in his embraoo.
mmm.
