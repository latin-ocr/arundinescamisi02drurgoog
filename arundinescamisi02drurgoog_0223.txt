illa virgin 11111111.

Tuon fool!
Thai gloriest in having power to ravish
A hille from me I am weary of :
What is this life to mel not w01²eh a thought 3
Or, if it be esteemed, 'tis that Ι lose ie
To win a bether: even thy mallee serves
Το me but aa a ladder lo mount up
Το such a height of happinese, where I shall
Look down with scorn on thee and on thew0r1d;
Where, cireled wilh true pleasuree‚ placed above
The reaeh of death or time, ·’twill be my glory
To think at what an easy price Ι bought it:
There’s a perpetual spring, perpetual youth 3

No joint-benumbing eold‚ 01· scorching heah,
Femina nor age, have any being there

messmam.

Tnn noiah-wind deth blow

And we shall have snow,
And what will poor Robin do lhen,

Poor fining‘l

He'll sil in a barn,
And keep himself wem,
And hide his head under his wing,

Poor thing.
