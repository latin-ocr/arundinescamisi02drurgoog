Sans Richard 1ο Thomas-and seem’d half afraid-
‘I’m thinking to marry thy mistress’e maid⁴
Now because Mra Luey 10 thee is well known,
I’ll do't if thou bid‘sa me, or let it alone.
Now don’t make a jesi on't3 ’tis no jesi 10 me, ·
For ’saith I’m in earnest, so prithee be frea.
Ι hnve no fault 10 find with the girl since I knew her,
But I'd have thy advice ere Ι 'aie myeelf 1ο her.’
Saye Thomas to Richard, ‘To speak my opinion,
There's not such a brute in king George's dominion3
And I firmly believe, if thou knew'st her ae I do,
Thou would'st choose out a whipping-post first te be
tied 10.
She’s paevish‚ she’s thievieh, she's ugly, she’e old,
And a liar and a fool and a siut and a scold’
Naxi day Richard hastened to Ohurch and was wed,
And ere night had informati her what Thomas had saia
emenone·

aaa: maan. ’

In Ι were a eobbler, I'd make ia my pride,
The best of all cobblers to be:

If I were a tinker, no tinker beside
should mend an old kettle like me.
