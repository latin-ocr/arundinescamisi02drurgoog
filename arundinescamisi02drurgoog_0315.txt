ARUNDINES CAMJ.

The inseet youth are on the wing,
Eager to teste the honied spring,
And fleat amid the liquid neon:
Some h'ghtly 0'er the current skim,
Seme shew their gaily-gilded trim
Quick-glaneing to the sun.

To Contemplation's sober eye

Such is the rece of man:

And they that creep, an'd they thet fly,

Shall end where they began„

Alike the busy and the gay
But ssutter through life’s little day,

In forfiune's varying colours dreet:
Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance,
Or ehill’d by age, their airy danae

They leave, in duee to rest.

Methinks I hear in aceente low
¹The sportive kind reply 3
Poor moralist! and what art thou?
A solitary flyl
Thy joys 110 glitt’n'ng female meets,
No hive hast‘ thou of boarded sweetS,
No painted plumage to display 3
On hasty wings thy youbh is flown ;
Thy sun ie eet, thy spring is gone:
We frolie while 'tis May.
· eRAY.
