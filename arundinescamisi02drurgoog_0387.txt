ARUNDINES olm,

no Mb.

Tuon bid’st me come away,

' And I‘ll no longer stay,
Than for to shed some bears
For faults of former years,
And lo repent some crimes
Dono in the present times3
Το don my robes of love,
Fit for tho place above 3 ’
To glrd my loins about

With ohan’ty throughoul:
And so to traval hence

Wifh feet of innoeence.
This done, I’ll only cry

‘God mereyl'-and so die.

Bnnnnnn a sleeping infant lies ;
To earth her lody lent
Herenfber shall more glorious riso,
But not more innocent.
And when the Archangel’s trump shall blow,
And souls to bodies join‚
Thousands shall wish their lives below
Had been as short as thina
