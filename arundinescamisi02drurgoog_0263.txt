Gor find some whispering ohode neore Arne or Poe,
And gently ’moug their violetu throw
Your weary’d limbo, aud see if all those faire
Enohuuturents oon oharme griefe or caru
Our sorroweo still pursue uu, and when you
The ruin’d capitol] shall view,
And statues e disorder'd hope, you eun
Not oure yet the diueuee of man,
And banish your owue thoughts. Goo humile rhoffi
Another sun oud stauros appeare, ⁸
And lund not touoht by any oovetouu fleet;
And yet even there your selfe youle meeto.
Stry here then, and while ourious exileo find
· New toyeo for a -fantastique mind,
Enjoy at home what's reull: here the Spring
By her aeriall quires doth sing
As sweetly to you, os if you were laid
Vnder the learn'd Thessaliuu shado
memoror.

Swhhs sing before they die: 'twere uo bad thing
Should certain persons die before they sing.
