cnm> and Campaspe play’d
At cardes for kisses5 eupid pay’d:
He stakes his quiver, bow and arms,
His mother’s doves‚ and teame of sparrows ;
Loses them too: then down he throws
The 'conl of his lippe, thoroso
Growing on's cheek (but none known how);
With these the crystal of his browe,
And then the dimple of his chinne ᾗ
ΑΗ these did my Gampaspe winne.
At last he set her both his eyes ;
She won, and cupid blind did rise.
Ο love! has she done this bo thee?
What shall, alas! become of mee?

’ΒΑΕ ba! black sheep,

Have you any woolss’

‘Yes, master, that we have,
Two bags full:

One for our master,

And one for our dame,

But none for the naughty boy
That lives in the lane!
