‘And has he left the birds and fiowemss
And must‘I call in vain‘i

And through the long long summer-houm
Will he not come again?

And by the brook and in the glado
Are all our wanderings o'er?
01 while my,br0ther with me played

Would I had loved him more 1’

§lueet 3112.

Swnm day, so cool, so calm, so bright,
The bridal-day of earth a1'1d sky,
The dew shall weep thy fate ¹ere night,
For thou must die.

Sweet rose, whose hue angry and bravo
Bids the rash gazer wipo his eye,
Thy root is ever in its grave,
And thou must die.

Only a sweet and virtuous soul,

Like seasoned timber, never gives ;
But, though the whole world turn to coal,
Then chiefly liveS.
