Swaas Echo, swsetast nymph, that liv'st unsean
within thy aery shall,
. By slow Meander’s margent green,

And in the violeaembmider'd vale,
Where the love-lom nightingale
Nightly to thee her sad song maumeth well:
Oanst thou not ten me of a gentle pair
Tha likest thy Narcissus aress
0! if thou have

de thamin some flovf'ry cave,
Tell me but where,
Sweet queen of parley, daughter of the sphe1
So may'st thou be translated to the skiss>
And give resounding grace to all heav'n’s harmoni

MILTON.
