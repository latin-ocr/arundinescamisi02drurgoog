152 ARUNDINES OAMI. -

tlte litte tf arturus.

For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl’d

Far below them iri the valleys, and the clouds are lightly
eurl'd

Round their golden houees, girdled with the gleaming
world:

Where they smile in secret, looking over wasted lende,

Blight end famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps
end fiery sande,

Olanging rights, and flaming towns, and einking ships, and
praying hands. ·

But they emile, they find a music centred inadeleful song

Steeming up, a lamentation and en ancient teleos wrong,

Like e tale of little meaning though the words are strongj y

Chanted from an ill-used rece of men thet eleeve the soil, ς

Sow the seed end reap the harvest with enduring teil,

Storing yearly little duee of wheet end wine end eil 3 Ι

Till they perish, and they suffer-some, 'tis whispered‚ ¹

Suffer endless angnish, others in Elysian valleys dwell,

Resting weary limbs et last 011 bede of asphodel.
