I au undone 3v there ia uo living, none,
If Bertram be away. It were all one,
That I should love a bright particular star,
And think to wed it, he is so above me:
In his bright radianoe and collaterel light
Must I be comforted, not in his sphera
The ambition in my love thus plaguea itself:
The hind that would be mated by the lion
Must die for love. ’Tvvas pretty, though a plague,
To see him every hour ; to sit and draw
His arched brows, his havvking eye, his curlo,

Α Iu our heart's table3 heart too capable
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
Must sanctify his relico.
