A roon old soldier shall not lio unknown,
without a verso and this recording stone.

'Twas his in youth o’er distant lands to stray,
Dangor and death companions of his way.

Here, in his native village, sterling age

Olosed the lone erening of his pilgrimage.

Spoak of the past, of names of high renown‚

Or bravo commandens long io dusi gono down3
His look with instant animation glowed,

Though ninety winters o'er his head had snowedl
Think, Stranger, thar his spirit lires with God,
And pluok the wild weeds from the lowly sod,
Where‚ dust to dost, beneoth the chanoel shado‚
Till tho last irump‚ a bravo man’s bones aro laid.
