ARUNDINES OAMI.

To all isleS, all coasts of furthest natione 3
All—but only those of Paradise.
Vainly o'er the world's wide surfuoe ranging,
Would’st thou seek that blessed spot to know,
Where bright Freedom's verdure smiles unehauging‚

Where life’s earliest flowers undying blow?
Endless lies 'ohe globe's hugo floating mansion,
Seorce oen soil its bulk enormous truce 3
Yet not all throughout ite vast expension
May 'oen happy beings find a ploce
To the heart’s still chamber, deep and lonely,
Must thou fiee from life'u tumultuous throng:
Freedom in the land of dreams is only,
And the Beuuteous blooms alone in song.
