Hm my chieken, my ohicken,
And hey my chieken, my deary!
Such a sweet pet as vthis
Was neither far nor neary.
Here we go up up up,

And here we go down down downy,
And here we go bsckwards and somariis,
And here we go round rormd roundy.

ΤΗΕΝ Alpheus bold,
On his glacier eold,
With his trident the mountains sirook3
And open'd a ehasm
In the rocks—with the spasm
All Erymanthus shook
And the blank south wind
It conceal'd behind
Thelurns of the sileni snow 3
And earihquake and thunder
Did rend in sunder
sshe bars of ihe springs below:
The beard and ihs hair
Of the River-God were
Seen through the torrent’s sweep,
As he follow’d the light ,
Of the fieei Nymph's fflght

To the brink of the Dorian deep
