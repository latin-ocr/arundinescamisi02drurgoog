Oonn here, fond youth, whoe’er thou be,
That boast’st to love as well as me,

And if thy breast have felt so wide a wonnd,
Come hither and thy flame approve3

And by what marks true passion may be found

It is to be all bathed in tears,
To live upon a smile for years,
To lie whole eges at a beauty's feet,
To kneei, to languish, to implore,
And still, though she disdain, adore.
It is to do all this, and think thy sufferings sweet.
