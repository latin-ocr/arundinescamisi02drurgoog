ARUNDINES OAMI.

Or thoe perehanoo o darker apoll
Enthrals: the smooth stores of tho flood,

By mountain grob or fell,

'Pho giant altor on tho rook,
The cavom whenoo the timbrel’o call

Affiights tho wandoriug fiock:
Thou long’st to soaroh' them all.

Trust nottho dangorouo path again—
0 forward step and lingering will!
Ο lov'd and warn'd in vain!
And wilt thou porish stille

Thy messago given, thino home in sight,

To tho forbidden feast return‘l
Yield oo the false delight
Thy better soul could spurnss

Alos, my brother! round thy tomb

In sorrow kneeling‚ and in seor,
We read the Pastor’s doom,
Who speaks and will not hear.

The groy·hair’d saint may fail at last,
The surest guido a wanderer provo 3
Death only binds us fast
Το the bright shore of love.
