§lon telleneu.

WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,
We were like them that dream.

Then was our mouth filled with leughter‚

And our tongue with singing:

Then said they among the Heathen,

The Lord hath done great things for them.

The Lord hath done great things for ue,

Whereof we are glad.

Turn again our captivity, 0 Lord,

As the streame in the south.

They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious
seed,
Shall deublless come again with rejoieing,
Bringing his sheaves with him.
Peme cxm.
