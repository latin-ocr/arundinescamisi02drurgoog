Mmmss Mary,

Quite oontmry‚

How does your gardan growh
With silver bellu,
And mcklffshelhh

And hyacinthe all of a row.

‘hu imantia.

You’LL have no scandal while you dine,

But honest talk and wholesome wine,
And only hear the magpie gossip

Garrulous under a roos of pino:

For groves of pine on either hand,

To break the blash of winter, stand 3
And further on, the hoary channel

Tumbles a breaker on chalk and sand5

Where if below the milky sheep
Some ship of battle slowly creep,
And on thro' zones of light and shadow

Glimmer away to the lonely deep,

We might discuss the Northern sin
Which made a selfish war begin ;

Dispute the claim, arrange the chances;
Emperor, Ottoman, which shall win.

TENNYSON.
