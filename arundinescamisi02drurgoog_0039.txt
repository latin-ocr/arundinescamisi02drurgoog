ARUNDINES OAMJ.

Θῦν tu mmmm.

DAuoffm of Jove, relentless power,

Thou tamer of the human breast,

Whose iron scourge, and torturing hour

The bad affrigffi, afflict the best!

Bound in thy adamantino chain,

The proud are taught to ‘taste of pain,

And purple tyrants ·vainly groan

With pange unfelt before, unpitied and alone.

When fimt thy Sira to send on earth
Virtue‚ his darling child, designed‚

To thee he gave the heavenly birth,
And bade to form her infant mind:
Stern rugged Nurse! thy rigid lore
With patience many a year she bore ;
What sprrow was, thou bad’st her know,

*And from her own she learned to melt at others‘

woe-
GRAY.
