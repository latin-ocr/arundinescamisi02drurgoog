ARUNDINES OAMJ.

When all the full-fae’d presence of tho Gods
Reng’d in the helle of Peleus: whereupon

Roee fond, with question unto whom 'twere due:
But lightfoot Iris brought it yestereve,
Deliv’ring that to me, by common voice

Eleoted umpire‚ Here eomes todey,

Pellae end Aphrodite, elaiming oeeh

This moed of fairest. Thou, within the eave

Behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine
May’st well behold them unbeheld unheerd

Heer all, end see thy Paris judge of Gode' ·

“Deer mother Ide, heerken ere I die!
It wan the deep midnoon: one silvery eloud
Hed lost his way between the piney sides

’ Of this long glen. Thon to the bower they oome5

Neked they eeme to thet smooth-swerded bower,
And et their feet the crocus brake like fire,
violet, amoremne, and asphodel,

Lotos, end lilios: ond e wind arose,

And overhead the wandering ivy and vine,

This way end that, in many e wild festoon

Ren riot, garlanding the gnarled boughs

With bunoh and berry end fiower thro' ond thro'.

“O mother Ide, heerken ere I diel
On the 'eree-tops e ereeted peaeook lit, ¹
And o’er him flow’d a golden cloud, and lean'd

Upon him, slowly dropping fragrant dew.
