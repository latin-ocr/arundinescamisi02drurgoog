Ο TRUAM Muse, what shall be thy amends

For thy neglect of 'eruth in beeuty dyedl

Both trulh and beauty on my love depende 3

So dost thou loo, and therein dignified.

Make snswer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say
‘Truth needs no eolour with his colour fixed,
Besuty 110 pencil‚ beauty's truth to lay 3

But best is besl, if never intermixed'l

Because he needs no preise, wilt thou be dumbl
Excuse not silence so 3 for it lies in thee

Το make him much outlive a gilded lomb,

And to be praised of ages yet to be.

Then do thy office, Muse ; I leaeh thee how

Το make him seem long hence as he shews now.
