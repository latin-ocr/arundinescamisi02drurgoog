ο 108 ARUNDINES OAMI.

(Μ’ thr dura.

As I gaed down the waterside,
There I met my shepherd lad,

He row’d me sweetly in his plaid,
And he oa'd me his dearie.

Orroa Oa’ the ewes to the knowes,
Oa’ them where the heather grows,
Oa' them where the burnio flowa,
My bonnie dearie.
Will ye gang down the waterside,
And see the waves sae sweetly glide,
Beueath the hazels spreading widel
The moon it shines fu’ clearly.

I was bred up ai nae sio school,

My shepherd lad, to play the fool,

And a’ the day to sit in dool,
And naebody to see me.

Ye shall gel gowns and ribbous meet,
Oauf-leather shoou upon your ieet,

And in my arms ye's lie and sleep,
And ye shall be my dearie.

If ye’ll bui stand to what you’ve said,

I's gang wi’ you, my shepherd lad,

And ye may rowe me in your plaid,
And I sall be your dearie.

While waters wimple to the sea,
While day blinks in the list sae hie,

Till olaycauld death sall blind my eye,
Ye shall be my dearie.
aureus,
