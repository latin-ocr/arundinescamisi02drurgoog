Ι aaa ravrarras orm.

&aparctiam

Uror the grass no longer hange the dev:

Forth hies the mower with his glittering scythe,

In anowy ehirt bedight, and all unbraeed

He moves ethwart the moad with sideling bend,

And lays the grase in many e svathey line.

In every field, in every lavn and meadovv,

The roueing voice of industry ia heard. ¹

The haycook rises, and the frequent rake

Sweeps on the fragrent hay in heavy wreaths.

The old and young, the veak and strong are there,

And, ae they can, help on the cheerful work.

The father jeers hie awkward half-grown lad,

Who trails his tavvdry armfull o'er the field:

Nor does he sear the jeering to repay.

The village oraole and simple maid

dest in their turns and raise the ready laugh:

All are companions in the general glee:

Till the bright sun, now past hie middle course,

Shoots down his fieroest bearna, which none may breve.

A troop ol weloome children o’er the lawn

With slovv and weary steps approach: some bear

In baalrets oaten cahos, or barley aeones,

And gusty choeac and atoups ol milk or whey.

Beneath the branohes‘ ol the spreading trec,

Or by the shady side of the tall rich,

They spread their homely fare, and seated round

Teste every pleasure‚ that a feast oen give.
JOANNA aarum,
