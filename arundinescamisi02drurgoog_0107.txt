ΗΕ thal seara daath or tortuaees, leh him leave me3
The elops lhat we have met with erown our conquest.

Common attempte are fit for common men;

The rare, the rarest spirita Can we be dauntedl

We that have amiled at sea at certain ruine,

Which men 011 shore bul hazarded would ahake all

We that have lived free in despite of fortune,

Laughed al the outstrelched arm of lyranny‚

As still too short te reaeh ua, shall we faint nowl

Ne, my braya malea, I know your fiery temper,

And that you can, and dare, as much aa men.

Oalamsty, that severs worldly friendshipa

(lould ne'er divide us3 you are still the sama,

The constant folloaers of my banished formes,

‘The instrumente of my revenge, the hands

By which I work, and faahion all my projecta
