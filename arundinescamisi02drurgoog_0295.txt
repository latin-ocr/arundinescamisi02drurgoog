Hm merle-eyed miden, 01011 in seber grey,
Whose soft approach the weery woedman leves,
As homewerd bent to hies his prattling haber,
J ocund he whishlee through the twilight grovee.

When Phoebus einks behind the gilded hills,
You h'ghtly o'er the misty meadows welk ;

The drooping daisies bathe in heneydewe,
And nurse the nodding violet’s hender staur

The panting Dryade, thatin day’s fieree heet
To inmost bowers and eooling caveres ran,

Return to trip in wauton evening danne 3
Old Silvan too returnS, and laughing Pan.

To the deep wood the clamemus rooks repair,
Lighh skims the swehlow 0’er the watery seene3

And from the sheep-cote end fresh-furrowed field
Some ploughmen meet, to wrestle 011 the green.

The swein, that artless sings on yonder· roek,
His supping sheep and lengthening shadow epies3
Pleased with the 0001, the calm, refreshful bour,
And with hoarse humming of unnumbered flies.
