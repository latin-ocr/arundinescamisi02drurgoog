264 ARUNDINIl'S OAMI.

Now every Pession sleepe 3 desponding Leve,
And pining Envy, ever-mellese Pride;

A‚holy enlm creeps o’er my peeeefnl eonl,
Anger end med Ambition'e s'eorms subside.

Ο modest Eveningl 0st let me appear
· A wandering votary in thy pensive trein 3
Listening to' every wildly-warbling threan,
what fills'with favewell sween thy dsrkening plein.

WAB'I'ON.

In gerret high, choked np with books,
Worn in his germenls as his looks,
Lanher in limb then dnstmen's ehovel,
But well to do in self epprovnl,
A Seholar sal above the crowd,
And thus soliloquised aloud
‘O heaven-sent precept! happy chance,
That shamed me of my ignorenoe‚
Laid useless soienee on the sheIf,
And bid me only Kwow menne!
⁴ O noble teil with tn'umph erowned,
Deep truth in deeper stndy found!
How long in silence have I been
The eleveresl, sweetest, besl of men!
Len me display myself unfurled
To the profoundly nescient world
The secret of all knowledge is to show it:
He only Knows whom people know to know it)
