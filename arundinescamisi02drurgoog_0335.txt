0 Lova, Leve, Love! Ο withering might!
“ Ο sun, that from thy noonday height
Shudderest when I sarain my sight,
Throbbing through all thy heat and light!
Lol falling from my constant mind,
Lo! parch’d and wither’d, deaf and blind,
1 whirl like leaves in roaring wind

Last night I wasted hateful hours
Below the city’s eastern towere:

· Ι thireted for the, brooks‚ the showers:

I rolled among the tender flowers3
I erush'd them on my breast, my mouth:

, I look'd ethwam the buming drouth

Of that long desem to the south.

mese night, when some one spoke his name,

From my swift blood that went and came,

A thousand little shafts of fiame

Were shive1²d in my narrow freme.
Ο Leve, Ο fire! once he drew
With one long kias my whole sou] through
My lips, aa sunlight drinketh dew.
