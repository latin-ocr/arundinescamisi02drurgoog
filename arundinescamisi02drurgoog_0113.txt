With cedere, chosen by Hie hand

From Lebanon, He plante the lend:
And makes lhe hollow eoae that roor
Proelaim the embergreese on shore.

-He caste (whereof we rather boesl)

The Gospel pearl upon our coast,
And in these rocks for us did frome
A temple where lo sound His name.

Ο leo our voice His praise exalt,

Till ie arrive at Hoeven's vault ;
Which then perhaps rebounding may
Eeho beyond the Mexique bey?

Thus sung they in the English boat
A holy and a cheerful note3

And all the way lo guide their chime

With falling oars they kept the time.

And where I would be I cannot.
