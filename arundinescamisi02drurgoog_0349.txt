314 ’ ARUNDINES OAMI.

And flashing round end round, and whirl'd in onereb,

Shot like a streamer of the northern moro,

Seen where the moving isles of winter shoolr

By night, with noises of the'northern sea.

So flash’d and fell the brand Excalibur:

But ere he dipt the surfaoe, rose an arm

Olothed in white semite, mystio‚ wonderful,

And caught him by the hilt, and brandish’d him

Three timeo, aud drew him under 111 the meer.

Smo, beautiful sweet einger,
These notes so low and clear 3

Oh, I could dver linger
Those mellow notes to hear!

I hear thee before daylight
Tuning betimes thy throat3

Audin the vesper twilight
Thy ohants prolonged float.

These brilliant notes thet quaver
Thou tun’st with conscious pride:
Thy guerdon is the favour
Of thy approving bride.

By faithful love inspired
Thou pourest in her ear
LoyS, thou art never tired
To‘sing‚ nor she to hear.
Aron.
