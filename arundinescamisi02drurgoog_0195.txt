‘erfl Sacrifico before the rising morn '

Vows have I made by fruitless hope impii-ed,

And from the infernal Gods, mid shedes forlorn

Of night, my elaughtered lord heve I required:
Celestiol pity I egein implore:

Restore him io my sight—great Jove, restorel’ ’

So speaking, end by fervent love endowed

With saith, ‘ohe Suppliani heevenward lists her hands 3
While, like the Sun emerging from a oloud,

Her eountenenoe brighiens, and her eye expands;
Her bosom heaves end epreedS, her stature grows5
And she expects the issue in repoee.

O terror! what haeh she perceivedl Ojoyl
What doih she look oni whom <ioth she beholdl
Her hero elain upon the beaeh of Troyl

His viial presencel his corporeel mouldl

It is-if sense deceive her noi-'iis hei

And e god leods him, winged Mereuryl

Mild Hermes epoho, and touched her with his wend
Thai calme ell seer, ‘Such grece heth orowned thy prayer,
Laodamia, that ai Jove's command

Thy husband walle the pathe of upper eir3

He eomes 'to terry with thee three houm' opocen
Accepi the gift, behold him face io feee !’
