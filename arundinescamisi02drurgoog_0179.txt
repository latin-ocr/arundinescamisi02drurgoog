Bmouss, dull Care,

I pr’ythee begone from me ς
Βοςουερ dull Care,

Thou and I shall never agree.

Long timo thou hast been tarrying here,
And fain thou wouldst mo kill;

But i' saith, dull θαι-ο,
Thou never shast have thy wilL

Τοο much Care
Will tum a young man goey3
’Τοο much Care
Will turn an old man to clay.

My wife shall dance and I will sing,
And merrily pass the day 3

For I hold it oue of the w'isest things
To drive dull Care away. ·

So begone, dull Care,
I pr¹ythee begone from me;
Begone, dull Care,

Thou and I shall never agree.
