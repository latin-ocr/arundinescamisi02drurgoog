Fun the cup and fill the can,
Have a reuse before the mom:
Every minute dies a man,
Every minute one is born

Drink‚ and let the parties rave:

They are filled with idle spleen,
Rising‚ falling, like a wave,

For they know not what they mean.

He that noars for liberty
Faster binde the tyrant’s power ;

And the tyrant's eruel glee
Forees on the freer hour.

Fill the can and fill the cup:
All the windy ways of men,

Axe but dust that rises up,
And is lightly laid again.

Greet her with applausive brenth, ,

Freedom, gaily deth she trenel,
In her right a eivic wreath,

In her left a human head.

No, Ι love not what is new:

She is of an ancient house,
And I think we know the hue ’
Of that cap upon her browe

Len her gol her thirst she slakes
Where the bloody eonduit runs 3
Thenher sweetest meel she makes
On the firstborn of her sons·
nnnnnson.
