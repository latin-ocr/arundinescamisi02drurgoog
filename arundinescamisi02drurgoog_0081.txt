ARUNDINES OAMI.

Then first I heard the voice of her to whom,
(loming thro' heaven, like a light that grows
Iarger and' olearer, with one mind the Goda
Rlee up for reverenee. She to Paris made
Proffer of royal power, ample rule

Unquestion’el overflowing ravenue

Wherewith to ambelliah state, ‘From many a vale
And river-sunder’d champaign clothed with eom,
Or labour’d mines undminable of ore: Α ·
Honour,’ ohe said, ‘and homage, tax and toll

From many an inland town and haven large, ¹

Meet-through beneath her shadowing eitadel,
In glaesy baye among her tallest towers?

“O mother Ida, hearken ere Ι die!
still she spahe on, and still she epake of power,
‘Which in all aetion i's the end of all;
Power fitted to the seaeon5 wlodombred
And thron⁷d of wisdom 3 from all neighbour orowne
Allianoe and allegiance, till thy hand
Fail from the sceptra-staff. Such boon from me,

From me, heav’n's queen, Paris, to thee king-born,
A shepherd all thy lise, but yet king-born,
Should come most welcome, eeeing men in power
Only are likest Gode, who have atlain’d

Reat in a happy place and quiet seete

Above the thunder‚ with undying bliee

In knowledge of their own supremaoy?
