ARUNDINES OAMI.

. Rests like a ehedow, and 1110 cicala sleeps„

The purple flowers droop: the golden bee
Is lily-eradled: I alone awake.

My eyes are full 01 team, my 110011 01 love3
My 11001110 breaking, and my eyes are dim,
And Ι am all a·weary 01 my life.

“O mother Ida, many-fountein’d Ida,
Dear mother Ida, heerken ere I die!
Hear me, Ο earth! hear me, Ο hille! O caves
That house 1110 00Ιά crown’d snake! Ο mountain

brooks‚

I am 1110 daughter 01 a River-G0d3
Hear me, 101· I will speale and build up all
My sorrow with my song, as yonder walls
Rosa slowly 10 0 music slowly breeth’d,
A cloud that gether'd ehape: ferit may be
11101 while I speak 0111, a little while
My heart may wender from its deeper woe

“Ο’111011101 Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,
Dear mother Ida, heerken ere I die! , ’
I waited underneath 1110 dawning hille:
Α1011 the mountain lawn was dewyeiark,
And dewy-dark 01011 the mountain pine:
Beautiful Parin, evil-bearted Paris,
Leading a jeeblack goat, white-horn’d, white-hoofd,
Came up from reedy Simois all alone.
