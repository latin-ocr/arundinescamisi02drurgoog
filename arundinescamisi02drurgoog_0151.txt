Thr Tremit village.

How often have I peus’d on ev’ry chnrm,

The ohelter'doot, the cultivated ferm,

The never-seiling broolr, the busy mill,

The decent ohuroh that topt the neighb'ring hill,
The hawthom burh with seete beneath the ehtde,
For talking ege und whisp'ring lovers model

How often have I blest the coming day,

When toil remitting lentits turn to play,

And ull the village trein, from labour free,

Led up their oporto beneeth the epi-ending tree3
While many a pastime oireled in the ehtde

The young contending‚ as the old surrey’d;

And many a gembol froliok'd o'er the ground,

And sleights of art and feets of strength went round3
And still uo each repeated pleesure tire,

Sueeeeding sports the mirthful band inspir'd:

The danoing pair that simply sought renown

By holding out to tire each other down;

The swain mietrustless of hio smutted free,

While secret leughter titter’d round the plaee3

The beshful virgin's sidelong looks of love,

The metron’s glenoe thet would those looks reprove:
These were thy dharms, sweet Villege; oporte like these
With sweet eueeeesion taught even toil to pleese3
These round thy how’re their cheerful influeneo ohed3
These were thy ohurms-but all these chame ere fied.
