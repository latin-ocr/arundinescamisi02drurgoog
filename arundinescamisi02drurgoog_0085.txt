So that my rigour, wedded to thy blood,
shall atrike within thy pulses like a God's,
To puoh theo forward thro' o life of rhome,

Dangero, and deeds, until enduronoe grow

Sinerid with action, and the fullgrown will,
Oiroled thro’ all experienceo pure law,

Commeasure perfect freedom'

Or hearing would not hear me, woe is mo!

“O mother Ida, many fountein’d Ida,
Dear mother Ida, heerken ere I die!

Fresh ao the foam, new-bath’d in Paphien w
With rosy elendor fingere backward drew
From her worm brows and bosom her deep ]

And shoulder: from the violets her lighr foo‘
Shone moy-white, and o’er her rounded form¹
Between the ehadows of ohe vine-bunohes,
Floo'ood the glowing sunlight‚ as she moved⁴

“Deer mother Ida, hearken ere I die!
She, with e subtle smile in her mild eye,
The herold of her triumph, drawing nigh,
Half-whioper'd in his eor, ‘I promise thee
The fairest and most loving wife in Greeoe)
