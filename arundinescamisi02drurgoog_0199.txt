Baaghm of Zmint.

Vnam daughter of Imrina,
Sprnng of old Anchiaas' line,

May thy brimmed wavaa for this

Their full tribute never miss

From a thousand petty rills,

That tumble down the snowy hills: ,
· Summer drought or ainged air

Never scorch thy tresses fair,

Nor wet October’a torrent flood

Thy molten crystal fill with mud.

May thy billows roll ashore

The beryl and the golden ore 3

May thy lofty head be crown’d

With many a tower and terrace round,

And here and there, thy banks upon,

With groves of myrrh and cinnamon.

maon.
