ι ABUNDINES OAMI.

ss ἕως uf Ξῐπῃειιεε.

Smo a song of sixpence,
A pocket full of rye:
Four and wenby blackbirds
Baked in a pie:
When the pie was opened
The birds began to sing ;
Was not that a dainty dish
To set before the King2

Tho King was in the parlour

Oounting out his money 3

The Quaen was in the chambot
Eating broad and honey3
The maid was in the garden

Hanging out the clothes:
Down came a little bini

,And cam'ed off her nose-
α. ο.
