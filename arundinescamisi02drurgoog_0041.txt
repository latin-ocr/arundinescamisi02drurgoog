ARUNDINES OAMI.

Tun Moon had olimbed the highest hill,

Which rises 0'er the source of Dee,
And from the eastern summit shed
Her silvery light o’er tower and tree3

When Mery laid her down to sleep‚
Her thoughts on Sandy far at sea,

When low and soft a voice she heard
Say, ‘Mary‚ weep no more for me’

She from lier pillow gently raised
Her head, to see who there might be 3
She sew young Sandy shivering stand,
With visage pale end hollow e'e.

‘O maiden dear, eold is my eloy,
‘It lies beneath a stormy sea ,·
‘Fan far from thee I sleep in death,

‘So Mary‚-weep no more for me.

ιΟ Maiden dear, thyself prepare 3
‘We soon shall meet upon that shore,
‘Where love is free from doubt and care,
‘And we shall meet to part no more? Ι

Loud orowed the coek3 the Shodow fled3
Nemore of Sandy eould she see 3
But soit the parting Spirit said,
‘Sweet Many, weep no more for me’
