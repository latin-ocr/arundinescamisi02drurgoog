How they said,

Down with it, down with it, even to the ground„

0 daughter of Babylon, waeted with misety,

Yea, happy shall he be that rewatdeth thee
As thou hest served us.

Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children,
And throweth them against the ahenea
psam cxxxvn.

{Roma

Bamsnan the house of sacred rest,
Amid a thoughtless throng

At length Ι heard its ereed confess’d‚
And knelt the saints among.

Artless his sarain and unadorn’d‚
Who spoke Christ’s message there 3
But what at home I might have scorn'd,
Now charm'd my famish’d ear.

Lord, grant me this abiding grace,
Thy words and sons to know ;
To pieree the vei] on Moses' face,
Although his speech be slew.
