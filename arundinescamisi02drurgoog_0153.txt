Ronm and Richard

Were two pretty men:
They both lay in hed

ΤΗΙ the clock struck ten3
Thon up starte Robin

And looks at the sky3
‘Ohl brother Rieherd‚

The sun’s very high!
You go before

With your botele and bag3
And Ι will come after

On little J ack neg!

I'en heare thy voice of melodie
In whispere of the summerre air3
I'll see the brightnesse of thino eye
In the blue eveninge’s shininge sterre 3
In moonlighbe beames thy pun'tie 3
And look on heavenne, to look on thee!
