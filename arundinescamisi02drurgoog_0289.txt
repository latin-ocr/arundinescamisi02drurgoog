, ‘011 eall my brother beck to me,
I cannot play alone:
The summer comes with fiower and hee:
Where ie my brother gone?

The huttexiiy is glaneing bright
Along the eumbeam's hraek;

I care not now ho chase ite flight:
Ο call my brother beck.

The flowers run wild, the flowers we sowed
Around our gamen-hee 3

Our vine is drooping with its load:
Ο eall him beck ho me !'

‘He would noh hear my voice, fair child3
He may noh come to thee:

The face, that once like spring-time smiled,
On earth no more thou'lt see.

A flower's b'rief brighe life of joy,
Such unho him was given:

Ge, thou mush play alone, my boy!
Thy brother is in heaven?
