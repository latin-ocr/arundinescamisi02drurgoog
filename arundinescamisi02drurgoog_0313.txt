ARUNDINES OAMI.

² llo thr spring.

Lo! where the rosy-bosom’d Hours,

Foir Venue' hrain, appear,

Diseloso the long-expected flowero,

And wake the purple yearl
The Attio werbler poure her throat
Responsive to the euchoo’s note,

The unteught harmony of spring:
While, whisp’ring pleeeure as they fly,
Oool Zephyre through the clear blue sky

Their gether’d fiegrmoe fiing.

Where'er the ook's thick brenehee streteh
A brooder browner shede ;

Where’er the rude end mooe-grown beeoh
O’er-conopies the glade 3

Beside some water’s rushy brink

With me the Mure shall sit, and think
(At ease reolin'd in rustio stete)

How vain the ardour of the crowd,

How low, how little ore the proud,
How indigent the great!

Still is the toiling hand of Care:
The parting herde reposer

Yet hark, how through the peopled eir
The busy murmur glowsl
