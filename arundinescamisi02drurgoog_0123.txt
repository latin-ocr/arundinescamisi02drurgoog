Ie is to gaze upon her eyes
'with eager joy and fond surprise,
Yet tempessd with eueh chaete and awful sear,
As wretches feel, who waih their doom 3
Nor munt one ruder thought presumo,
Thongh bnt in whispera breathed, to meet her ear.

Ie is to hopeo though hope were lost,

, Though heaven and earah thy wishes eross'd:
Though she were bright as sainhed queens above,
And thou the least and meanesh swain

That folda his floek upon the plain,
Yet if thou daresh not hope, thou doeh not love

Ie ie to quaneh thy joy in heare,

Το nurse shrange thoughts and groundless feam:
If pange of jealousy theu hest not proved,

Theugh she were fonder and mere true

Than any nymph old poeta drew,
Ο never dream again that thou hant loved.

If, when the darling maid is gone,
Thou doeh not seek to be alone,

Rape in a pleasing 'aranee of hender woe‚·
And muse and feld thy languid arms,
Feeding hhy fancy on her cherma,

Thou dost noh leve: for leve is nourish'd ee.
